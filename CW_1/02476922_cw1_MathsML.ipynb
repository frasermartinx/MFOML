    "Let $\\hat{\\mathcal{F}}$ be the full class of functions $f:\\mathcal{X} \\to \\mathcal{Y}$. Assume we have data $(x,y) \\sim D = \\mathcal{X} \\times \\mathcal{Y}$. Consider a loss function $L:\\mathcal{Y}\\times\\mathcal{Y} \\to \\mathbb{R}$.\n",

We then seek an $\\hat{F}$ that minimizes this.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in practical situations, we do not know $D$. Hence we approximate the true risk with the empirical risk, which, for a sample $(x^{(i)},y^{(i)})_{i=1}^N$ assumed to be iid from $D$, is the average loss over the sample (which would converge to the true expectation by LLN), which is defined as $\\hat{R}(f) := \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N L(f(x^{(i)}),y^{(i)})$.\n",

    "The benefits of a large hypothesis class are that they can in general contain a much wider class of function than small hypothesis classes, meaning, assuming we choose it wisely, we have more flexibility and potentially more complexity possible, and a bigger space to search for the optimal function in. If we are searching over a bigger space then we are more likely to find a better function to fit the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, as seen with the generalisation bound for a finite hypothesis class, the bound for the generalisation error increases logarithmically with the size of the class of functions. That is, the bound for how well the function generalises to unseen data increases logarithmically with the size of the class of functions. Also, there is always the risk of overfitting with a more complex class."

When we take the training/validation split there is still randomness involved. Perhaps on a different seed a different model would be selected as the best on the validation set. The validation set is also finite, and in this case, small, compared to the training data. Thus, the validation data may have not been able to capture enough variability in the data for it to generalise well to a new test dataset. The selected model may have gotten \"lucky\" on this specific validation set. This is why often there is a training/validation/test split performed, to evaluate performance on data that has not been used to either train the model or tune hyperparamters, since the results can show things such as overfitting/failure to generalise to new data."

For the specific context of image representation, we should be using low dimensional feature vectors (compressing the data), whilst still being able to represent the important features in the image. For example, in the MNIST dataset, lots of the pixels towards the edge of the images are represented as a 0, since the important distinguishing part of the images are towards the centre, thus we can compress the images by removing the parts of the vector containing the edges of the images (assuming the matrix representation has been flattened to a vector)."

This helps to reduce overfitting, since then it limits how much each feature can be relied on for prediction. In the case of the Lasso regularisation term, parameter values can actually be shrunk to 0, meaning the optimisation can result in a model of lower dimensionality, which again helps to reduce overfitting."

    "#### Question 9 (Momentum gradient descent):\n",
    "\n",
    "The issue with gradient descent is that when the Hessian matrix of the objective function is ill conditioned, the condition number is extremely large, meaning that the algorithm is slow to converge. We can think of this as when we make a step, the function takes a bigger step in one direction than others, which can lead to oscillations. Since we only have one parameter $\\alpha$ to control this step size, it becomes very difficult to get a balance of step sizes in different dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Momentum helps this by introducing a memory term that tracks the accumulated gradients across the iterations. We have a hyperparameter $\\beta$ that controls how quickly these contributions of previous gradients exponentially decay. Then, when an update is made, the step is dependent on the current velocity (gradient) and all previous gradients (scaled by this hyperparameter). This helps address slow convergence and oscillations caused by the ill conditioned Hessian matrix."

Then, like most algorithms, it samples a minibatch, before performing an interim parameter update $\\tilde \\theta = \\theta + \\alpha v$ using the inital velocity. Next, the gradient is computed using this interim parameter and the minibatch, $g = \\frac{1}{m} \\nabla_{\\tilde \\theta} \\sum_i L(f(x^{(i)};\\tilde \\theta),y^{(i)})$. Next, the gradient is accumulated $r:= \\rho r + (1-\\rho)g\\cdot g$ where here the dot represents element wise multiplication.

This means that parameters who have had large gradients in the past have a large decrease in learning rate, while parameters that have had smaller gradients only get a small decrease in learning rate. This helps to avoid taking such large steps in directions that are already decreasing fast, and bigger steps in directions that have a flatter slope."

    "#### Question 12 (Decaying Learning Rate):\n",
    "\n",
    "A decaying learning rate is often useful, since without one, the descent algorithm can get stuck around a local/global minimum unable to get any deeper, because the steps it takes towards the minimum are too large, resulting in overshooting. When a decaying learning rate is used, the algorithm takes smaller and smaller steps as the iteration counter increases, which hopefully results in no overshooting. However, this has to be tuned, since there is the risk of the step size decreasing too fast, resulting in the algorithm not moving anywhere, despite not being at a local/global minimum. This is why one can opt for a constant learning rate up until iteration $T$ before decaying from then onwards."

By the requirements of the lemma, we have that $f:X \\to \\{0,1\\}$. This means that, for a given loss function, there are only 4 possible input states for $L_i$. Hence we can think of $L_i$ as a bounded random variable with 4 possible outputs. Set $a_i = \\min L_i, b_i = \\max L_i$. These will be the same for all $i$. Moreover, $L_i$ are independent since the sample is. Set $S_N = \\sum_{i=1}^N L_i$. Then we have $P[\\hat{R}(f) - R(f) \\ge \\epsilon] = P[\\frac{1}{N}S_N - \\frac{1}{N}\\mathbb{E}[S_N] \\ge \\epsilon] = P[S_N - \\mathbb{E}[S_N] \\ge N\\epsilon]$. Finally, we can use Hoeffding's inequality to get $P[S_N - \\mathbb{E}[S_N] \\ge N\\epsilon] \\le \\exp(\\frac{-2(N\\epsilon)^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^N(b_i-a_i)^2})$. Then, since $a_i,b_i$ are constant, set $(b_i - a_i)^2 = K$, then the exponential simplifies to $\\exp(\\frac{-2(N\\epsilon)^2}{NK}) = \\exp(\\frac{-2 N\\epsilon^2}{K}) =  \\exp(-2 N\\epsilon^2)$ since $\\epsilon$ is arbitrary, and $K$ is constant. This gives us the result $P[\\hat{R}(f) - R(f) \\ge \\epsilon] \\le \\exp(-2 N\\epsilon^2)$, as required. The other inequality follows in the exact same way from the other inequality in the Hoeffding's inequality theorem.\n",

This result shows that as the size of the dataset, $N$, increases, the probability of the empirical risk being more than some value $\\epsilon$ from the true risk for a given hypothesis $f:X \\to \\{0,1\\}$ decreases. This makes sense, we would expect to converge to the true risk in some way when we collect more data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The term $|\\mathcal{F}|$ in theorem 4.8 refers to the size of the function class, or, the number of possible functions we are considering. In the context of the theorem, this term means that generalisation bound for a fixed hypothesis increases logarithmically with the size of the function class. So the more functions we are considering, the greater the potential generalisation error. A balance needs to be attained between the error we are willing to accept and the number of functions we want to potentially consider."
