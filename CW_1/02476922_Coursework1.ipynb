We then seek an $\\hat{f}$ that minimizes this.\n",

Hence we approximate the true risk with the empirical risk, which, for a sample $(x^{(i)},y^{(i)})_{i=1}^N$ assumed to be iid from $D$, is the average loss over the sample (which would converge to the true expectation by LLN), which is defined as $\\hat{R}(f) := \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N L(f(x^{(i)}),y^{(i)})$.\n",

If we are searching over a bigger space then we are more likely to find a better function to fit the data.\n",

When we take the training/validation split there is still randomness involved. Perhaps on a different seed a different model would be selected as the best on the validation set. The validation set is also finite, and in this case, small, compared to the training data. Thus, the validation data may have not been able to capture enough variability in the data for it to generalise well to a new test dataset. The selected model may have gotten \"lucky\" on this specific validation set. This is why often there is a training/validation/test split performed, to evaluate performance on data that has not been used to either train the model or tune hyperparamters, since the results can show things such as overfitting/failure to generalise to new data.

For example, in the MNIST dataset, lots of the pixels towards the edge of the images are represented as a 0, since the important distinguishing part of the images are towards the centre, thus we can compress the images by removing the parts of the vector containing the edges of the images (assuming the matrix representation has been flattened to a vector)."

We can think of this as when we make a step, the function takes a bigger step in one direction than others, which can lead to oscillations. Since we only have one parameter $\\alpha$ to control this step size, it becomes very difficult to get a balance of step sizes in different dimensions.\n",

We have a hyperparameter $\\beta$ that controls how quickly these contributions of previous gradients exponentially decay.

This helps address slow convergence and oscillations caused by the ill conditioned Hessian matrix."

Then, like most algorithms, it samples a minibatch, before performing an interim parameter update $\\tilde \\theta = \\theta + \\alpha v$ using the inital velocity. Next, the gradient is computed using this interim parameter and the minibatch, $g = \\frac{1}{m} \\nabla_{\\tilde \\theta} \\sum_i L(f(x^{(i)};\\tilde \\theta),y^{(i)})$. Next, the gradient is accumulated $r:= \\rho r + (1-\\rho)g\\cdot g$ where here the dot represents element wise multiplication.

This means that parameters who have had large gradients in the past have a large decrease in learning rate, while parameters that have had smaller gradients only get a small decrease in learning rate. This helps to avoid taking such large steps in directions that are already decreasing fast, and bigger steps in directions that have a flatter slope."

    "\n",
    "A decaying learning rate is often useful, since without one, the descent algorithm can get stuck around a local/global minimum unable to get any deeper, because the steps it takes towards the minimum are too large, resulting in overshooting. When a decaying learning rate is used, the algorithm takes smaller and smaller steps as the iteration counter increases, which hopefully results in no overshooting. However, this has to be tuned, since there is the risk of the step size decreasing too fast, resulting in the algorithm not moving anywhere, despite not being at a local/global minimum. This is why one can opt for a constant learning rate up until iteration $T$ before decaying from then onwards."

By the requirements of the lemma, we have that $f:X \\to \\{0,1\\}$. This means that, for a given loss function, there are only 4 possible input states for $L_i$. Hence we can think of $L_i$ as a bounded random variable with 4 possible outputs. Set $a_i = \\min L_i, b_i = \\max L_i$. These will be the same for all $i$. Moreover, $L_i$ are independent since the sample is. Set $S_N = \\sum_{i=1}^N L_i$. Then we have $P[\\hat{R}(f) - R(f) \\ge \\epsilon] = P[\\frac{1}{N}S_N - \\frac{1}{N}\\mathbb{E}[S_N] \\ge \\epsilon] = P[S_N - \\mathbb{E}[S_N] \\ge N\\epsilon]$. Finally, we can use Hoeffding's inequality to get $P[S_N - \\mathbb{E}[S_N] \\ge N\\epsilon] \\le \\exp(\\frac{-2(N\\epsilon)^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^N(b_i-a_i)^2})$. Then, since $a_i,b_i$ are constant, set $(b_i - a_i)^2 = K$, then the exponential simplifies to $\\exp(\\frac{-2(N\\epsilon)^2}{NK}) = \\exp(\\frac{-2 N\\epsilon^2}{K}) =  \\exp(-2 N\\epsilon^2)$ since $\\epsilon$ is arbitrary, and $K$ is constant. This gives us the result $P[\\hat{R}(f) - R(f) \\ge \\epsilon] \\le \\exp(-2 N\\epsilon^2)$, as required. The other inequality follows in the exact same way from the other inequality in the Hoeffding's inequality theorem.\n",

This result shows that as the size of the dataset, $N$, increases, the probability of the empirical risk being more than some value $\\epsilon$ from the true risk for a given hypothesis $f:X \\to \\{0,1\\}$ decreases. This makes sense, we would expect to converge to the true risk in some way when we collect more data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The term $|\\mathcal{F}|$ in theorem 4.8 refers to the size of the function class, or, the number of possible functions we are considering. In the context of the theorem, this term means that generalisation bound for a fixed hypothesis increases logarithmically with the size of the function class. So the more functions we are considering, the greater the potential generalisation error. A balance needs to be attained between the error we are willing to accept and the number of functions we want to potentially consider."

    "The table shows that, the deeper (5 and 10 layer) neural networks did infact lead to more overfitting on the data. They obtained smaller best train losses than the shallower (1 layer) network, but also had higher values for the best test loss. This is especially evident in the 10 layer network which had nearly double the best test loss than the 1 layer network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing did show that a smaller learning rate was required to train the deeper network. Higher learning rates simply lead to the model getting stuck at certain loss values for both testing and training. The layer 1 network had better performance with a slightly higher learning rate, however it was important to keep this hyperparamter consistent across this experiment since we only wanted to change the depth.\n",

    "The plot and table both show that as the width increases, the best training error and test error decrease, but both do reach convergence by approximately a width of 128. The training loss is very close to 0 at this point, whilst the test loss converges to a value of around 0.06-0.07. Increasing the width past this point does decrease the losses by a very small amount, however these gains are very marginal. Realistically, a width of 128 or 256 would be acceptable to fit the data. One could use larger width models, however, as stated with Occam's razor, we should be favouring sparser models if they perform just as well as more complex models, which is the case here.\n",

Thus, when we are considering collections of outputs from a layer, the vectors $(w_{ij}^{(l)}g_{j}^{(l-1)}(x), w_{ij}^{(l)}g_{j}^{(l-1)}(x'),...)^T$ are iid as we vary $j$.\n",

    "Finally, as before, we add the bias term vector, where each component is $b_i^{(l)}$, which is Gaussian with mean 0 and covariance matrix given by a matrix of the same dimension as the covariance matrix for the sum, but filled with $\\sigma_b^{(l)}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, since this was for any length collection, the collection $f_i^{(l)}(x)$ is a Gaussian process with mean $\\mu_{l-1} = 0$, and covariance matrix $K^{(l-1)}$, which is the matrix of covariances from $k^{(l-1)}(x,x') = \\sigma_b^{(l)}+\\sigma_w^{(l)}\\mathbb{E}[g^{(l-1)}(x)g^{(l-1)}(x')]$, where again we drop the subscript since the expectation product is the same for every $j$.\n",

    "The computational cost of the NNGP model lies in the inversion of the matrix $K(X,X) + \\sigma^2 I$. This inversion has computational complexity $O(N^3)$. Hence as the size of the training dataset increases, this inverse will become harder and harder to compute. This is why other inversion methods like the Cholesky inverse can be utilized. However, even with this method, it can become infeasible to invert should the training dataset become large enough."
